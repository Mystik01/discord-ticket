This bot is written in Discord JS v12, NOT Version 13.
Run `npm ci` for same versions I used or `npm install discord.js@12`.





# Discord Ticket Bot

This custom ticket bt is made using MySQL, this is based on **[Anson the Developer's](https://www.youtube.com/c/AnsonDevAcademy/)** 
**[ Discord.JS v12 Ticket Bot [FULL TUTORIAL]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KctjPfO5LxU)** video. 

**Setup**
The setup to this is a little bit complicated if you are not used to making or seeing Discord Bots or Javascript in code, the files currently are setup to my customization so you will need to change a lot of the messages.

**Features**
- Embed Messages
- Reaction to create a ticket
- Categories for the tickets
- Won't delete the channel when reslved so you can save any nessary details (optional)


**Support**
If you need help, join this Discord server:
[https://discord.gg/d9Au6uf3Px](https://discord.gg/d9Au6uf3Px)
Or...
Create an issue ticket, I can't guarantee I can always help you though because I'm not a very adavnced developer yet (I'm still learning).

**HOW TO SETUP MYSQL**
To setup the Mysql database, copy and paste the ``example.env`` file and re-name it to just ``.env``. then you can delete the ``example.env``. 
After just edit the ``.env`` file to your configurations.
